# React Jobs

React Jobs is a web application that allows users to search for jobs based on their location and job title. The application utilizes the GitHub Jobs API to fetch job listings and display them to the user. Users can also filter job listings based on the job type (full-time, part-time, etc.) and location.

## Project Background

This project was created as a personal endeavor to enhance my React skills and explore new libraries such as Toastify, react-router-dom, react-icons and few more. By building React Jobs, I aimed to gain hands-on experience in developing a web application that integrates with external APIs and incorporates advanced UI components.

## Key Features

- Seamless integration with the GitHub Jobs API for fetching job listings.
- User-friendly search functionality based on location and job title.
- Filter options for job type (full-time, part-time, etc.) and location.
- Implementation of the Toastify library for enhanced user notifications.

## Getting Started

To run the web app, execute the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

To run the API server, execute the following command:

```
npm run server
```

The server will run on port 8000.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or above is required to run the server. If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download it from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Installation

1. If Node.js is already installed, run the following command to check the version:

```
node -v
```

If you need to update Node.js to the latest version, you can run the following command:

```
npm install -g npm@latest
```

2. To install the project dependencies, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start using the React Jobs web application!
